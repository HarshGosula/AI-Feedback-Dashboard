The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\n\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.\n\nAnyway, I can't wait to go back!\"\nStars: 5\n\nExample 2:\nReview:\n\"love the gyro plate. Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection :)\"\nStars: 4\n\nExample 3:\nReview:\n\"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza? Absolutely not! Bad service. Maybe the guys grandma died I don't know. I want to tell you what really made me mad about the experience. We order the small pizza and salad and the guys could have cared less and took our $ and we sat down. We were looking around and hmm, there's a sign saying \"x large pizza and large salad only 23$\". Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. \n\nTo the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials. Something so small can affect a customers experience negatively. \n\nAnd your salads are severely overpriced \n\nWon't go back unless I'm desperate.\"\nStars: 2\n\nExample 4:\nReview:\n\"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and this place was incredibly empty.  They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!\n\nNext up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are \"seasoned\" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.\n\nMy entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.\n\nIt wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.\"\nStars: 3\n\nExample 5:\nReview:\n\"U can go there n check the car out. If u wanna buy 1 there? That's wrong move! If u even want a car service from there? U made a biggest mistake of ur life!! I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service, guess what? They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now. If without fixing the problem. Might bring some serious accident. Then she did what they said. 4 brand new tires, timing belt, 4 new brake pads. U know why's the worst? All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!!
