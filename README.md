# ⭐ AI Feedback System — User + Admin Dashboards

This project implements a fully web-based AI feedback system with two dashboards:

- **User Dashboard** → allows users to submit a star rating and written review, and instantly receive an **AI-generated response**.
- **Admin Dashboard** → displays all submissions along with **AI summaries, recommended actions, analytics, and realtime updates** without refresh.

The system is powered by **Next.js (JavaScript)**, **Supabase**, **Google Gemini**, and deployed on **Vercel**.
